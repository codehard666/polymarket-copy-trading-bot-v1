# ENS Resolution Fix - Successfully Resolved ✅

## Issue Summary
The Polymarket copy trading bot was encountering a "network does not support ENS" error when trying to claim positions. This occurred because ethers.js was attempting to resolve large token IDs as ENS names when the contract ABI incorrectly specified the parameter type as `address` instead of `uint256`.

## Root Cause
- **Problem**: Contract ABI defined the redeem function as `redeem(address _tokenAddress, uint256 _amount)`
- **Actual Contract**: The function signature should be `redeem(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _amount)`
- **Error**: Large token IDs like `21742633143463906290569050155826241533067272736897614950488156847949938836455` were being interpreted as potential ENS names by ethers.js
- **Network Issue**: Polygon network doesn't support ENS resolution, causing the error

## Solution Implemented ✅
Fixed the contract ABI definitions in all relevant files by correcting the parameter type:

### Files Updated:
1. **`/src/services/claimPositions.ts`** - Main claim positions service
2. **`/claim-all-positions.js`** - Standalone claiming script  
3. **`/src/services/tradeExecutor.ts.new`** - Alternative trade executor version

### Changes Made:

#### Before (Incorrect):
```typescript
const POLYMARKET_CTF_ABI = [
    'function redeem(address _tokenAddress, uint256 _amount) external'
];
```

#### After (Correct):
```typescript
const POLYMARKET_CTF_ABI = [
    'function redeem(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _amount) external'
];
```

### Variable Updates:
- Updated variable naming from `tokenAddress` to `tokenId`
- Updated comments to reflect correct parameter understanding
- Maintained all existing functionality while fixing the type issue

## Test Results ✅
- **Status**: All tests passed successfully
- **Error Resolution**: The "network does not support ENS" error has been eliminated
- **Code Quality**: No linting errors or TypeScript compilation issues
- **Functionality**: Claim positions feature now works correctly on Polygon network

## Technical Details
- **Contract Address**: `0x4bfb41d5b3570defd03c39a9a4d8de6bd8b8982e` (CTF Exchange)
- **Network**: Polygon (Chain ID: 137)
- **Parameter Type**: `uint256` for token IDs (not `address`)
- **ENS Support**: Disabled in provider configuration as fallback safety measure

## Benefits
1. **Error Elimination**: No more ENS resolution errors when claiming positions
2. **Correct Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types for contract interactions
3. **Improved Reliability**: Claims now execute successfully on Polygon network
4. **Better Documentation**: Code now accurately reflects the actual contract interface

## Validation
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Tests pass without ENS errors
- ✅ Contract calls work correctly with uint256 token IDs
- ✅ All functionality preserved
